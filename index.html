                        <h2>About Me</h2>
                        <p>I am a web developer who is located right outside of Atlanta, Georgia. My interests include playing video games, sports and spending time with friends, family and my two adorable dogs. Before becoming a web developer, I worked as a licensed social worker. I was initially attracted to the social work field because I enjoy working with people; however, after exploring different social work positions, I discovered that I craved a career that involved innovation and design. 
                                I was first introduced to coding through my brother, a Game Design major, who recommended that I learn C#. As I began experimenting with C# and making basic games in Unity, I discovered that I enjoyed both the coding and design process. Just like my favorite choice driven video games, coding is like a puzzle that can be solved in a variety of ways. 
                                As my passion for coding grew, I decided to change careers and become a web developer. In June 2019, I  enrolled in Thinkfulâ€™s Engineering Immersion Program to begin my journey as a web developer.</p>
